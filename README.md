# The Mazing Race
A game by Zachary Segall

## The Game

#### Setting up
The game starts with an empty 10 by 10 tile board. 
One player starts at the bottom right corner; the other starts at the bottom left.

#### The Goal
Each player is trying to cross the board to reach the corner diagonally opposite
of the corner that they start on before the other does.

#### Turns
1. The player can move one space in any direction (up, down, left, right)
that is not blocked by a wall.
2. The player must place a wall one an unoccupied border between two tiles.
Walls cannot be placed so that they prevent either player from reaching their goal.
